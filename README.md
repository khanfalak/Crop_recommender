# Crop_recommender
## Uses Distill Ensemble -> Keras Student 
We'll predict soft probabilities with the voting ensemble and train a small Keras model to mimic them. The neural network is the student and teacher model will be xgboost+SGD

## For autodetecting the location, uncomment the geocoder block in the next crop prediction block
